This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dockerfiles: using an unspecified base image version and lacking robust error handling during package installation.  The `Dockerfile` showcases the problem, while `Dockerfile-solution` provides a corrected and improved version.

**Problem:** The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which is prone to unexpected changes in the base system.  Furthermore, it doesn't include error handling for potential issues like package installation failures.  This could result in non-reproducible builds and hard-to-diagnose problems.

**Solution:** The `Dockerfile-solution` addresses these issues by specifying a particular version of Ubuntu as the base image and implementing better error handling.
